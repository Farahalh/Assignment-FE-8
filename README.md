 Exercise 8: Bootstrap 5 - Coffee Party

A First Prototype for a Company Website
You have been tasked by an innovative young company whose core process is to deliver coffee and coffee machines to other businesses. They also host a very popular coffee party event that both individuals and companies can order. At the coffee party, a variety of coffee types are presented for tasting along with dark chocolate, and attendees have the opportunity to purchase the products.

You are to create a website with three pages: "Home," "Products," and "About Us."

For all pages (3 in total):

A suitable and consistent color theme.
Header; with a logo or company name (or both).
Navbar; with links to all pages.
Footer; with a copyright date and webmaster.
Home:

Divided into four main sections:
Who are we?
What do we do?
Why us?
Coffee Party, how it works!
These divs should contain placeholder text (Lorem Ipsum) and placeholder images. A quick Google search can provide good images for a prototype, but if you're short on time or looking for very specific sizes, placehold.it is a handy tip.
Products:

Separate Coffee Party and Coffee Machines.
List coffee machines, different models with texts and images.
The layout should be divided into two parts:
Coffee Machines
Lists coffee machines in a grid.
Information, model, and price should be clearly visible.
Coffee Party
Divided into two parts: Business and Private Individuals.
About Us/Contact:

Contains more information about the company.
Contact information with an image, phone number, name, and email for the CEO.
Contact information with an image, phone number, name, and email for the HR Manager.
The page should work equally well on mobile devices and regular desktop computers.

This exercise is intentionally left quite open and is meant to be an opportunity to experiment and test various aspects of Bootstrap.

Good luck!
